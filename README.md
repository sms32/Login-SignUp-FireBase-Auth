## 🔥 Firebase Setup

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

### 🔐 Add Firebase Config

In your project, create a file:

\`\`\`
src/firebase.js
\`\`\`

\`\`\`js
// src/firebase.js
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getAuth } from "firebase/auth";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "your-app.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-app",
  storageBucket: "your-app.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "1:123456789:web:abcdef"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
\`\`\`

✅ Make sure you don’t commit secrets — add \`firebase.js\` to \`.gitignore\` if needed.

---

## 💡 Run the App Locally

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

Open your browser at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
